<p>It's the most wonderful time of the year!</p>

<p>Thanks to Eric Wastl, I am counting my holidays down in 2020 solving programming puzzles. <a href="https://adventofcode.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Advent Of Code</a> is a journey of 25 two-part coding challenges, each delivered in sequence at midnight (starting Dec 1<sup>st</sup>) all the way to Christmas. If that's not exciting enough for you, all these challenges are connected via a intricate storyline where you save Christmas. Now who doesn't want to do that!</p>

<p>Even though this is the 6th year of this coding tradition, I just discovered it today. I know I am late even for this year but I am determined to catch up and see how far I can go.</p>

<p>I am going to be documenting my progress here, but at the same time, I don't want to ruin the journey for anyone else. This is more in the spirit of knowledge sharing, encouraging some friendly competition and having fun together. I am going to keep it brief, highlight interesting observations if any and leave my code here. Let me know if you have a better or more creative solution because that's what this is all about!</p>

<!-- <p><b>Note</b>: I soon started to realize that these challenges don't expect the most optimal code. So my priority became exercising my brain just enough to finish the challenges in time and enjoying the holidays. So disclaimer for possible sub-optimal code. However, I might come back and re-code some solutions later for my own fun.</p> -->

<!-- I have mentioned the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">complexity</a> of my code in most cases unless it's too obvious or just too convoluted, but they might not be tightest or the most optimal. I have been generous in those calculations because  -->

<p>Alright, here we go.</p>

    <br><br><span class="box">Difficulty: Medium</span>  
    <p>Converting the list of rules to a more code-consumable form (I chose a dictionary) is an important first part in solving this problem. I went with a recursive solution with memoization for Part One and utilized the concept of recursive grounding for Part two (or atleast that's what I think it is called). In recursive grounding you start off with set of knowns (the answer for bags which cannot contain any other color is 0) and slowly expand your "known" (or grounded) set by computing the plausible "unknowns". Part two cannot be solved if the containment structure is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting#:~:text=In%20computer%20science%2C%20a%20topological,before%20v%20in%20the%20ordering." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">topologically</a> impossible.</p>

    <p>Part one is a step-by-step mimic of code execution following the NOPs and JMPs and keeping track of the accumulator, till you hit a line you have already executed.</p>
    <p>For part two, since it's a given that you need only one swap and input is not insanely big, I tried brute-forcing it (try every swap) and it was fast enough! There might be a more optimal way to do it, not entirely sure at this point. Onward for now!</p>

    <p>The crux of the logic for this problem is in finding the neighbours. Once that's implemented, to compute the next state, all you have to do is iterate through each cell, identify it's neighbourhood occupancy and accordingly update it's own occupancy. Keep iterating from one state to the next till it stabilizes. I am using <a href="https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/shallow-deep-copy">deepcopy</a> to make a copy of the current state as occupancy changes are done simulataneously and also due to how assignment works in python.</p>

        <p>Then I starred at the screen and it hit me! I am looking at a system of modulo equations. How do you solve that?

        <li>A 0 or 1 in the mask overrides the corresponding bit in value.</li>

    <p>For achieving this transformation, decompose the given mask into an AND mask, an OR mask and a collection of possible OR masks for Xs (capturing the various resolved configurations). The AND mask carries over the bits in 0 as it is and zeros out the positions that need to be overriden. The OR mask then places the ones in the appropriate zeroed out positions. The collection of OR masks for Xs are then be applied to place the resolved 0/1 (s). There would be 2<sup>Numbers of Xs</sup> possible OR masks</p>

    <p>A significant part of Part One is parsing all the input and making it code-consumable. But don't worry, Part One in entirety is an investment for Part Two.</p>
    <p>In Part One, you have to find all the invalid values. To tackle it more generically (in hindsight of Part Two), I identify all satifying contraints for a given value and report back ones which have zero satifying constaints.</p>
    <p>For Part Two, you attempt to utilize your knowledge of these satifying constaints for each value to uniquely identify what the ticket field can be. A value satifying a contraint essentially means that the corresponding field is a potential candidate for being the right assignment. I tackle this iteratively. Values with only one potential candidate can get assigned right away. With these out of the mix, we obtain a reduce problem set. Repeat until we have uniquely identified all assignments or hit a blocker where we conclude that it is not possible.</p>

    <p>Another one straight out of CS undergrad and this one is from Compilers. These rules essentially form a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_grammar">Formal Grammar</a>. Since the grammar doesn't have any loops you can recursively resolve the rules to pull out a regex expression for "0". After you get the regex, it's as simple as iterating through all the strings and seeing if it's a match.</p>
    <p>Part Two attempts to jog a little bit more of your undergrad memory. Do you remember how to expand recursive rules? What regex special characters can you leverage here? Can you take advantage of your knowledge of the length of strings in the input to come up with less complex regex?</p>

    <p>I think Eric was feeling a tad generous with it being Christmas and all. Just one part and brute-force-able. Thank you very much!</p>
    <p>Having to implement <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_exponentiation">modular exponentiation</a> may have possibly made it a little more demanding but lucky for me, I am using python.</p>

<p>I felt Advent Of Code 2020 to be pretty comprehensive. It was a rather well-rounded 25 (or 10 for me) days of coding. It started off easy but stepped up soon after. There were challenges where the logic was simple but the code got too long. There were also challenges where both the logic and the code got complex (Jurrasic Jigsaw!). My sweet spot are the ones with a tricky logic but simple code. In this respect, I really enjoyed <b>Adapter Array</b> and <b>Shuttle Search</b>. With regard to testing my basics and DSA staples, I had fun with <b>Binary Boarding</b>, <b>Operation Order</b>, <b>Monster Messages</b> and <b>Crab Cups</b>. On an overall, it was good to be working on my DSA skills and also to be coding in Python as we all usher in 2021! </p>

<p>Thanks for reading! Since you got all the way down here, you get a bonus tidbit. Looking to hone your DSA skills? Or maybe just want to experience Advent Of Code 2020 but don't have the time or patience to do the whole thing? Follow my stars!</p>
