<p>It's the most wonderful time of the year!</p>

<p>Thanks to Eric Wastl, I am counting my holidays down in 2020 solving programming puzzles. <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent Of Code</a> is a journey of 25 two-part coding challenges, each delivered in sequence at midnight starting Dec 1<sup>st</sup> all the way to Christmas. If that's not exciting enough for you, all these challenges are connected via a intricate storyline where you save Christmas. Now who doesn't want to do that!</p>

<p>Even though this is the 6th year of this coding tradition, I just discovered it today. I know I am late even for this year but I am determined to catch up and see how far I can go.</p>

<p>I am going to be documenting my progress here through a series of blogs, but at the same time, I don't want to ruin the fun for everyone else who is trying. So I am going to keep it brief, highlight interesting things if any and leave my code here. After the holidays are over, I may pick out a few real kickers and delve deeper. Let's see.</p>

<p>Alright, here we go.</p>
