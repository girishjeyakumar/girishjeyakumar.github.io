<p>It's the most wonderful time of the year!</p>

<p>Thanks to Eric Wastl, I am counting my holidays down in 2020 solving programming puzzles. <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent Of Code</a> is a journey of 25 two-part coding challenges, each delivered in sequence at midnight starting Dec 1<sup>st</sup> all the way to Christmas. If that's not exciting enough for you, all these challenges are connected via a intricate storyline where you save Christmas. Now who doesn't want to do that!</p>

<p>Even though this is the 6th year of this coding tradition, I just discovered it today. I know I am late even for this year but I am determined to catch up and see how far I can go.</p>

<p>I am going to be documenting my progress here, but at the same time, I don't want to ruin the journey for anyone else. This is more in the spirit of knowledge sharing, encouraging some friendly competition and having fun together. I am going to keep it brief, highlight interesting observations if any and leave my code here. Let me know if you have a better or more creative solution because that's what this is all about!</p>

<p>Alright, here we go.</p>

    <p>Given a list of integers,</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Part One requires you to find two numbers which sum upto 2020 and then return their product.</li>
        <li>Part Two requires you to find three numbers which sum upto 2020 and then return their product.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Pretty straightforward array traversal with little modulo trick to handle the infinite recurrence towards the right.</p>

    <p>Hardly a thinker. Just a lot of careful coding to pick out "passports" (each being a dictionary key-value pairs) which have necessary keys and values that satisfy certain specified constaints.</p>

    <p>Interesting one. The algorithm for deriving the seat id is essentially binary search and part two is a minor extension that is just a slight variation of LeetCode Easy <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/missing-number/">Missing number</a></p>.
