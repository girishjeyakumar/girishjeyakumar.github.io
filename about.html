<p>Borrowing Michael Scott's wise words, when I decided I wanted to create a website for myself "I knew exactly what to do. But in a much more real sense, I had no idea what to do." But "somehow I manage(d)" and here we are .</p>

<p>Hello, World! I am Girish Jeyakumar. I am a Software Engineer II at <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft</a>, currently living in one of the most beautiful cities in the world - Vancouver, Canada. I admit that the tedious amount of rainfall does bother me but well, atleast I am not under 20 feet of snow like most of Canada during winter.</p>

<p>I am an undergraduate alumni of the Computer Science and Engineering department at the <a href="https://www.iitm.ac.in/">Indian Institute of Technology Madras</a> - a top-tier engineering institute in India which has an acceptance rate of less than 2%.</p>

<p>I love travelling and exploring the world. I have moved around quite a bit during my lifetime, but my home has been and will always be Chennai, India. It is super hot and traffic kills, but I love it with all my heart. My cliched dream as a traveller is to go all around the world and fill my map with so many pins that one can no longer see any land!</p>

<!-- <p>I am a total health nut. I strive to exercise regularly - weight training, hiking, tennis - and care a lot about what I eat. To be honest, I do think a lot of this is born out of my paranioa of dying too early due to my sedentary career choice. But would this encourage me to change my career? Nah, I love what I do and that's what matters doesn't it.</p> -->

<p>I love listening to and making music. I started out with the guitar back in college and I have branched out since then into entirely producing, mixing and mastering my covers. I am passionate and I put out <a href="{{"/music" | relative_url }}">music</a> as often as I can.</p>
