<p>Borrowing Michael Scott's wise words, when I decided I wanted to create a website for myself "I knew exactly what to do. But in a much more real sense, I had no idea what to do." But "somehow I manage(d)" and here we are .</p>

<p>Hello, World! If you haven't already figured it out, I am Girish Jeyakumar and this website is my attempt to consolidate everything about me that I want to share with the world.</p>

<p>I am a software engineer at <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft</a> currently living in one the most beautiful cities in the world - Vancouver, Canada. I admit that the tedious amount of rainfall does bother me but well, atleast I am not buried under 20 feet of snow like most of Canada during winter.</p>

<p>Wait, you were already impressed at Microsoft? Hold your horses. I am also an IITian - alumni of the Computer Science and Engineering department at the <a href="https://www.iitm.ac.in/">Indian Institute of Technology Madras</a> - a top-tier engineering institute in India which has an acceptance rate of less than 2%.</p>

<p>I am an avid traveller and love exploring the world. I have moved around a quite a bit during my lifetime, but my home has been and will always be Chennai, India. It is super hot and traffic kills, but I love it with all my heart. My cliched dream as a traveller is to go all around the world and fill the map with so many pins that one can no longer see any land!</p>

<span class="caption text-muted">Long way to go but I am working on it!</span>

<p>I am a total health nut. I strive to exercise regularly - weight training, hiking, tennis - and care a lot about what I eat. To be honest, I do think a lot of this is born out of my paranioa of dying too early due to my sedentary career choice. But would this encourage me to change my career? Nah, I love what I do and the money is just too good.</p>

<p>I love listening to and making music. I started out with the guitar back in college and I learnt a little bit of the piano since then. I have also been trying my hands at singing, producing, mixing etc. I am passionate and I put out music regularly (as much as I can). Keep a close eye, I might explode to be a new star any day.</p>

<p>Alright, so that's about it. Surf through my wesite, check out my <a href="{{"/posts/" | relative_url }}">blog</a> and <a href="{{"/music" | relative_url }}">music</a>. You want to talk to me? Feel free to reach out via email or any social media linked below.</p>
